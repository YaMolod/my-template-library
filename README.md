# Welcome to MTL

A selective implementation of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) written from scratch. This project is focused on educational purposes, featuring a clean, readable coding style to demonstrate the internal mechanics of standard data structures and algorithms.

## Features
- **Educational Design:** Code is structured to be easily readable.
- **Custom Implementations:** Selective coverage of essential STL components (e.g., containers, iterators, and utility functions).
- **Modern C++:** Written with modern standards in mind, compatible with the latest compilers.

## Getting Started & Building Tests

The project uses a batch-based generation system to set up the Visual Studio environment quickly.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YaMolod/my-template-library.git
2. **Generate the environment:**
   
    Run the `GenerateProjects.bat` file located in the root directory.
  - *Note: If you are using a different version of Visual Studio, open the `.bat` file in a text editor and update the version string.*
3. **Build the Solution**
